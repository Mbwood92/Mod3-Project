Introduction: A paragraph used to introduce interested parties to the project and needs to include one or more screenshots.
For my project, I create a E-commerce application called Herbal Haven. Its a application displaying herbal remedies. The application shows what a user would see if they were to sign up or log in their page. Once logged in, the user will be able to make purchases, and write reviews. Anyone who doesn't have an account would not be able to make submit reviews about the website products. 

Unsolved Problems: Unable to save the reviews if you click on the category page, no check out button, trouble shooting images/used emojis instead

Future Enhancements: Able to see and purchase products without logging into account, shopping cart icon, each category will have its own page, critique on web design, images to products will be added, add a logo.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
